# Learning Assembly: A RollerCoaster Tycoon-Inspired Scene Project

## Status (as of 2026-09-21) — read this first when picking the project back up

**Done: Stage 0 through Stage 6b.** Only **Stage 6c (scale to 50v50)** is left.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/BlueFalconDevelopment/assembly-simulation (public, pushed and up to date)
- **Local path:** `~/Claude/Assembly_Simulation/`, one subdirectory per stage (`stage1/`, `stage2/`, ... `stage6a/`, `stage6b/`), each with its own `Makefile` and `README.md`. `make` in any stage directory builds every `.asm` file in it into `build/`.
- **Each stage's README.md is the real changelog** — read those before re-reading this file's roadmap. They document what each numbered file adds, plus (from Stage 6a onward) real bugs found during verification and how they were fixed. `stage6b/README.md` in particular documents five bugs found while building the capstone's obstacle/line-of-sight logic — worth reading before writing any more `update_soldiers` code, since a couple of those bugs are the kind that are easy to reintroduce by accident (see "traps to avoid" below).
- **Extensive session walkthrough** (commands, code, the full bug-hunting narrative) written up in `~/Claude/tech-blog/newPOSTS/` for a future blog post — good background reading to re-orient on how this was built, not just what was built.

### To pick 6c back up

1. `cd ~/Claude/Assembly_Simulation/stage6b && make && ./build/02_line_of_sight` — confirm it still builds and runs (soldiers dodge the wall, ranged weapons respect line of sight, fight resolves in ~10-15s).
2. Copy `stage6b/02_line_of_sight.asm` as the starting point for `stage6c/01_scale_up.asm` (it already has the full feature set: soldiers, pickups, obstacles, line of sight).
3. Bump `NUM_PER_TEAM` from 8 toward 50 and rebuild. Per the performance note below, this should be a non-issue computationally — the real work is making sure spawn geometry, obstacle placement, and pickup count still make sense at that scale (e.g. more pickups will likely be needed for 100 soldiers than the current 4 fixed + 4 drop slots).
4. **Test with many repeated runs, not one.** Every real bug found in Stage 6a/6b was invisible in a single playthrough — see "traps to avoid" below.

### Traps to avoid (hard-won this session)

- **A single test run proves nothing about fairness.** Two separate real bugs (a missing `call rand` that silently un-fixed an earlier turn-order bias, and a pickup-layout symmetry mismatch) each produced *deterministic-looking* one-sided win rates (24 of 24 games, in one case) that were invisible until running 10+ games in a row and counting. If you change spawn positions, pickup positions, or anything in `update_soldiers`'s processing order, re-run a batch of 10-20 games and check the win split before trusting it.
- **Sampling once a second can hide an infinite loop.** The nastiest bug this session (a soldier stuck oscillating between two positions forever, `y=0 -> y=2 -> y=0 -> ...`) looked like a plain freeze when sampled every 60 ticks, and only became obvious tracing every single tick. If something looks "stuck," trace every tick for a short window before concluding it's just slow.
- **A raw `syscall` clobbers `rcx` and `r11`.** Used more than once this session for quick debug `write()` prints stuffed into the middle of existing code — if `r11` (or `rcx`) is holding something you still need afterward, save/restore it around the syscall or you'll get a very confusing crash that looks unrelated to the actual change.
- **`gcc -no-pie` is required** when linking anything that calls SDL2 (or any extern C function) from hand-written asm using plain `call func` — without it you get `relocation ... can not be used when making a PIE object`. Already baked into every stage's Makefile from stage2 onward; just don't drop it if writing a new one from scratch.

## Why

Chris Sawyer wrote 99% of RollerCoaster Tycoon (1999) in hand-coded x86 assembly using MASM, with just 1% C to glue it to Windows/DirectX. The goal here is the same spirit, scaled down: learn x86-64 assembly by building toward a capstone simulation, almost entirely by hand — a two-team deathmatch: soldiers armed with knives, pistols, and shotguns, fighting until one team has no one left standing.

## Setup

- **Environment:** Ubuntu desktop (Ryzen 7 3700X, RX 6600, 32GB RAM)
- **Experience level going in:** total beginner — never written assembly
- **Ambition:** go big — a large-scale two-team battle simulation, not just a static scene

## The stack

- **NASM** — the assembler
- **System V AMD64 ABI** — the calling convention (args passed in `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, `r9`) — this is the bridge to calling SDL2
- **gcc** — used *only* as the linker driver, to get a working entry point and dynamic linking without writing any C code
- **gdb** — debugger
- **SDL2** — window / input / pixel-blit layer, called directly from assembly (the modern equivalent of Sawyer's thin C-to-DirectX glue)

## Roadmap

### Stage 0 — Toolchain ✅ done
- [x] Install nasm, gdb, build-essential, libsdl2-dev

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nasm gdb build-essential libsdl2-dev
```

### Stage 1 — Fight the registers until they make sense ✅ done
- [x] Registers, `mov`, arithmetic, the stack, `cmp`/jumps
- [x] Linux syscalls directly — no libc (e.g. print a string)
- [x] System V calling convention basics
- Expect a couple of focused days, not weeks — unglamorous but short.

### Stage 2 — Open a literal window ✅ done
- [x] Link against SDL2
- [x] `SDL_Init` / `SDL_CreateWindow` / `SDL_CreateRenderer`
- [x] Clear the screen to a color, handle the quit event
- [x] Stable, frame-timed main loop (not spinning the CPU)

### Stage 3 — Draw a scene by hand ✅ done
- [x] Get a raw pixel buffer (an SDL texture written into directly)
- [x] Compute byte offsets yourself: `row * pitch + col * 4`
- [x] Write your own line/rectangle plotting
- [x] First real "scene" — backdrop, ground, whatever fits the idea
- (The line-stepping logic written here gets reused later for line-of-sight checks in Stage 6.) — **confirmed**: `draw_line`'s Bresenham walk from this stage became `line_blocked` in Stage 6b, unchanged in algorithm, just swapping `set_pixel` for an obstacle check.

### Stage 4 — Make something move ✅ done
- [x] Per-frame animation driven by state you update each tick
- [x] Proper frame timing + double buffering

### Stage 5 — Let the player touch it ✅ done
- [x] Read keyboard/mouse events via SDL
- [x] Let input change the scene — this is where "scene" becomes "sim"

### Stage 6 — Capstone: team deathmatch battle simulation

**The design:**
- Two teams of soldiers fight to the death; last team with anyone standing wins.
- Weapons: knife (melee), pistol (medium range), shotgun (short-to-medium range, damage/accuracy falls off with distance).
- Everyone starts with a knife only. Pistols and shotguns spawn on the map as pickups soldiers have to reach and fight over.
- When an armed soldier dies, their weapon drops back onto the map and stays in circulation (adjust if you'd rather pickups be one-time).
- Battlefield has obstacles/cover, not just an open field.
- Target scale: 50+ vs 50+, reached by scaling up once the core logic is solid (see build order below).

**Per-soldier data:**
- position (x, y)
- health
- team id
- current weapon (none / knife / pistol / shotgun)
- state (seek_weapon / seek_enemy / attack / dead)
- target (enemy index or pickup index)

**AI loop, per living soldier, per tick:**
- If unarmed (or knife-only) and a weapon pickup is closer than the nearest living enemy → move toward the pickup, pick it up on contact.
- Otherwise → find the nearest living enemy (compare squared distances, skip the square root), move toward them if out of range, attack if in range.
- Attack resolution depends on weapon: knife = contact range, pistol = medium range, shotgun = short-to-medium range with falloff.
- End of tick: count living members per team; stop when one team hits zero.

**Randomness needed:** hit rolls / damage variance. Start by calling libc's `rand()`/`srand()` via `extern` (same pattern as linking SDL2). A hand-rolled xorshift RNG in pure assembly is a nice later swap-in, not a blocker.

**Build order — three sub-steps, not one big leap:**

**6a. Core loop at small scale (start here)** ✅ done — `stage6a/` (4 files: `01_spawn_soldiers`, `02_seek_enemy`, `03_combat`, `04_weapons`)
- [x] Small team size (6–10 per side) — open field, no obstacles yet (8 per side)
- [x] Weapon pickups: knife start, pistol/shotgun spawns, drop-on-death
- [x] seek_weapon / seek_enemy / attack state machine
- [x] Combat resolution for all three weapons (pistol has range, shotgun has real distance-based falloff)
- [x] Win condition check
- Found and fixed a real fairness bug here: fixed iteration order gave team 0 a first-strike advantage in every mutual engagement (11/12 win rate). Fixed by randomizing per-tick processing direction with `rand()` instead of a naive alternation (a naive fixed-period alternation made it *worse* by resonating with the attack cooldown's period — see `stage6a/README.md`).

**6b. Add obstacles** ✅ done — `stage6b/` (2 files: `01_obstacles`, `02_line_of_sight`)
- [x] Simple rectangular cover placed on the map (one wall, two segments, a gap in the middle)
- [x] Movement: if the straight line to the target is blocked, step left/right (or up/down) and take the first clear direction (not full A* pathfinding) — with a "sticky" per-soldier direction preference (`Soldier.avoid_dir`) to avoid a nasty 2-tick oscillation bug found this session
- [x] Line of sight for ranged weapons: reuses the line-stepping logic from Stage 3 (`line_blocked`) — walks the line from shooter to target, checks for obstacle cells in the way
- Five real bugs found and fixed during verification, all documented in `stage6b/README.md` — worth reading in full before extending this code further.

**6c. Scale up** — not started, the only remaining item
- [ ] Bump the agent array size to 50+ vs 50+
- [ ] Confirm the same logic (no algorithm changes, just loop bounds) still holds together
- [ ] Will likely need more than 4 fixed + 4 drop-slot pickups at this scale — worth reconsidering pickup count/placement, not just soldier count
- [ ] Re-verify fairness (win-rate distribution across repeated runs) and crash-safety at the new scale, same discipline as 6a/6b — don't assume what held at 8v8 automatically holds at 50v50

**Performance note:** even at 100 total soldiers, an O(n²) nearest-enemy scan is trivial for modern hardware in hand-written assembly — this scale is not a performance problem. The real risk is debugging complexity, which is why 6a comes before 6c rather than the other way around.

## Expectations

- Stage 0–2: a weekend or two of steady effort
- Stage 3 onward: the real learning curve — a multi-week arc to the capstone, not a sprint
- It's normal for Stage 1 to take longer than it looks like it should
- 6c (the 50+ vs 50+ scale-up) is a stretch goal — don't worry about it until 6a and 6b are solid
